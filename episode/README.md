## ðŸ§  Overview

These queries demonstrate:
- Fetching **individual episode details** by ID using the `episode(id: ID!)` field.  
- Fetching **paginated lists of episodes** using the `episodes(page: Int)` field.  
- Selecting fields such as `id`, `name`, `air_date`, and `episode` for structured results.

This provides foundational GraphQL experience with **real-world pagination, filtering, and schema exploration**.
